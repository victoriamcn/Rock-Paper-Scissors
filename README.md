## Usage

## Game Play

- User types R, P, or S to signify my choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
    1. R = rock
    2. P = paper
    3. S = scissors

- The computer will randomly choose R, P, or S in return.

### Project Specifications

1. Must use the `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` methods to collect user input and display information to the user.
2. The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game.
3. User's total wins, ties, and losses are displayed after each round.
4. User has the option to play again whether they win or lose.
